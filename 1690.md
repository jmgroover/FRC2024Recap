## Mechanical Things of Note
### Chassis
- Custom Swerve
  - 1:5.4 gear ratio ("or something like that")
  - Kraken and Falcons
### Intake
- Under the bumper.
- Side centering wheels powered by bevel gears.
### "Indexer"
- NA
### Shooter (Speaker/Amp)
- 20% note compression.
- No spin added.
- "Trigger" rollers that feed note into shooter flywheels.  "Trigger" rollers powered along with infeed rollers.
- Initially used regular aluminum tubes covered in rubber, but rubber inflated at high RPMs, so they switched to vulcanized rubber fused to aluminum tubes, which does not inflate.
- Rack gear/pinion system to move the arm (inspired by 971's turret).  Pinion is dowel pin wheel, rack gear is cycloidal gear drive
  - Rack gear is steel (custom machined), mounted to aluminum sub-structure.
- 
### Climber
- Carbon fiber/3D printed double jointed arms.
- Hooks attached via magnets.
- Hooks pulled down via winch.  Arms stay up.
- Trap scoring:
  - Single servo releases trap door opener, which is composed of a linear slide which is pulled open via a constant force spring, and a hinged joint which opens via a torsion spring.  There is one set of this on each side of their shooter.  These push the trap door open, then they just use the amp scoring mechanism to put the note in the trap.
### Bumper
- Single piece wraparound bumper
### Vision
- Lots of crazy software.
### Miscellaneous
- Whole robot under 1 ft tall when stowed.
