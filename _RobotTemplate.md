## Mechanical Things of Note
### Chassis
- Milled billet chassis
### Intake
- Under bumper
- Small passive rollers to reduce friction
- Flush mount break-beam sensors
### Shooter (Speaker/Amp)
- Rollers top and bottom
- Fixed angle (adjust top and bottom speeds to get different angles)
- Lower rollers have lower durometer (softer) material.  This helps "curve" the note for more reliable amp scoring.
### Climber
- Single hook, telescoping climber
  - Was this changed for Worlds?
- Powered by single Falcon motor, geared 64 : 1 (Rev Max Planetary)
- Telescoping arm appears to be at an angle (~20 degrees from vertical)
