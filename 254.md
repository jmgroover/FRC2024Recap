# 254 - The Cheesy Poofs
## Overview
- Location: San Jose, CA
- [Robot Reveal]()
- [Behind the Bumpers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IykJdvD_h7k)
## Mechanical Things of Note
### Chassis
- Swerve (modified)
  - Changed drive pinion to 13 tooth. Gears it down, reduces current draw, not a huge impact on speed.
- 3x1 frame extrusion
- Electronics mounted on drive base.
### Intake
- Under bumper.
- Mechanum wheels on sides, solid rubber wheels in middle.
- ["Cat tongue"](https://www.amazon.com/CATTONGUE-GRIPS-Non-Abrasive-Waterproof-Outdoor/dp/B08CS3Q3Y4/ref=asc_df_B08CS3Q3Y4/?tag=hyprod-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=693071814637&hvpos=&hvnetw=g&hvrand=1900890884141334762&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1021148&hvtargid=pla-943334569814&mcid=2ec8c4630ad83c06ba5cc46abb25a7ec&gad_source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQjwir2xBhC_ARIsAMTXk84ZYRqVm2Y14aqzJjoAXxjyYfH8OvOJyheVXOSxsYJLwKAYtWrN1lAaAnaZEALw_wcB&th=1) tape on most of rollers (other teams used as well).
- Passive 3D printed rollers just outside mechanum rolls.
- One way ramp, held in by springs.  Allows the note to come in from the bottom, but if they try to push it back out, it redirects it up into the amp scoring mechanism.
### "Spindexer", "Pizza Box"
- Turret, can rotate 720 degrees.
- Uses an energy chain wrapped around the motors.  Why not use a chain?
- Pizza box: flat circular area surrounding the turret.  Wheels on the inside spin in such a way that the note is always brought around to a ramp where it gets pulled in and fed into the shooter.
### Shooter (Speaker)
- Top and bottom rollers.
- Weren't initally happy with spin up time, so they aded inertia flywheels to maintain shooting consistency (more moment of inertia).
- Note different size wheels Left and Right to induce spin.
- Angle actuated via drive pinion/gear.
### Amp/Trap
- "Chopstick" approach: A pair of rollers grabs the note at a slightly offset orientation so when the feeder rolls (below) lose it, it flops out.  Then they reverse the "chopstick" rolls to push it out into the amp or trap.
### Climber
- Single arm, winched downwards.
- "Jack shaft" that drives both sides equally.
- Climber gearbox integrated into intake gearbox.  What does he mean by this?
### Bumper
- 
### Vision
- 
### Miscellaneous
- Krakens everywhere
- Final climb sequence is all automated.
  - First they raise the arms.
  - Then they press the button.
  - It climbs.
  - The elevator raises up.
  - It feeds the note up into the amp/trap scorer.
- "Poop mode"
- Lots of fancy controls.
