## Mechanical Things of Note
### Chassis
- Swerve.
### Intake
- 6mm polycarb with 1/16" aluminum on sides.  Less bending, more flexible.
- Over the bumper (can be wider, they like this)
- Easily removable intake subsystem (6 bolts).
- Full width of robot.
- Beam Break Sensor
### "Indexer"
- Pushes the note from intake into either shooter (for speaker) or elevator system (for amp or trap).
### Shooter (Speaker/Amp)
- Top and bottom flywheels.
- Flywheels only on one side.  Induces lots of spin on the note, and provides very stable flight.
### Climber
- Single stage elevator, used for both amp and trap.
- Chain drive
### Bumper
- Two piece bumpers
### Vision
- Two Arducams, OpenCV (Python) 
### Miscellaneous
- They use Kraken motors
